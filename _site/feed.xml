&lt;p&gt;I want to thank you for featuring these women. They are all amazing. Women in the workplace no matter the industry or role have a shared experience. That experience has shared frustrations, disappointments, excitement and pride in work we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this post misses a crucial point about the fight to get more women into tech. It seems to suggest that a solution to getting more women into tech is to broaden the definition of what “in tech” means.
A company who defines “women in tech” so broadly plays a slippery numbers game. If your workplace is 50% engineering/product and 50% non-engineering/product, but 100% of your engineers are men and 100% of non-tech is women, your company still has a “women in tech” imbalance problem. Technically you could say your workplace is 50/50 but that is not addressing a MAJOR issue many tech companies face: that the product is envisioned, designed, created, implemented and maintained by men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…we’re happy to report that a majority of our hires in several departments have been primarily female, being well over 55% in each of the marketing, business services, and People @AppD (human resources and recruiting) sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love that you have increased your numbers overall. We need more women in the workplace everywhere. All women no matter what they do deserve opportunities. No profession is superior to another. However I noted you are missing engineering, product and management roles on this list. To address the women in tech numbers in this way obscures the truth. It gives companies and individual engineering teams an easy out when it comes to diversity numbers. Don’t let them do that. It will harm efforts to increase women in technical roles. It ignores what it means to be a woman on a technical team and what it took to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I would love to share some of the reading I found about how people define women in tech. It’s an interesting discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

As a graduate of Dev Bootcamp as well as university with an engineering degree, I will throw in my own two cents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;theory-vs-practice&quot;&gt;Theory vs Practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At UIUC, many of my electrical engineering courses had no practical lab work at all. The one time we really sat down to design and create a practical project with purpose was in senior design. That was a single semester long class. College believed in a strong theoretical basis. Most classes with lecture and homework took 12 hours of work per week. Pencil and paper all the way. A CS course at UIUC involved many hours in a lab coding and working out assignments called Machine Problems. The focus is learning to apply the theory- but not necessarily to real life situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dev Bootcamp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dev Bootcamp was a different model of learning than traditional college educations. Dev Bootcamp had minimal lectures. The theory was scant to nonexistent compared to the education I had at U of I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they say it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill. At 15-20 hours per week for the first 9 weeks and then at least 12 hours per day per week for the last 9 weeks, You are nearly a 10th of the way there. Practice, practice, practice every day and all day. If you learn best by hands on application, this is an excellent model. You have well seasoned professionals at hand to mentor and coach. They do not give you the answer- they let you ask your question then say ‘so why did you do that, what is going wrong and what’s the error?’. This is much the same response you’d get from a professor in office hours. But with professors, it’s 1 professor per 200 students (plus some teaching assistants). At Dev Bootcamp, it is 2 teachers for 20 students (plus teaching assistants).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-merits&quot;&gt;Technical Merits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took Data Structures in college, which is one of the most fundamental courses in computer science. I think I learned more in this class than any other. And it was by far the  most useful. It came in use for every technical job interview I had. Every computer science major will tell you ‘Know your Data Structures’. Data Structures was the one course where I spent significantly more time doing lab work and practical problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And despite the fact that very little time is devoted to a hands on curriculum, the fact that 3 people are able to design, implement and demo a full project in 1 semester is nothing to sneer at. My senior design project went quite well. You have proven technical chops. The number of companies and recruiters milling around campus is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dev-bootcamp&quot;&gt;Dev Bootcamp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dev Bootcamp will not teach you data structures. You will know how, when and why to use an array vs a hash (not a hash table). However, you will not be formally taught any other data structures. Dev Bootcamp is directed to fast track you on your way to becoming an agile and adaptable web developer. It is VERY important to know that Dev Bootcamp in particular focuses on web development. It does not claim to be an alternative to a computer science degree. It promises to make you a web developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think of Dev Bootcamp as a semester long extension of my undergrad degree. Only instead of splitting my time haphazardly among different 3-4 courses (1 of which was actually interesting), I was able to channel all my efforts into one particular subject that I loved. That is a HUGE and often overlooked factor in what makes Dev Bootcamp a very successful choice in education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programming Languages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;university-of-illinois&quot;&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very fundamental languages. In this order, I learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assembly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;C&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;C++&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dev Bootcamp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web languages. All scripting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ruby/Ruby on Rails&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Javascript&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTML/CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;personal-growth&quot;&gt;Personal Growth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your experience at college is what you make it and there is little else to say. I threw myself at a lot of nontechnical extracurriculars that pushed me out of my comfort zone and at one point had me speaking in front of 2,000 people. In college, the mentality and approach to learning is very very different. Everyone is there with the goal to graduate and get a job. Sometimes, it feels like sink or swim. There are a lot of people and a lot of opportunities waiting…if only you can find your own direction. It is very much up to you to set a course and sail it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dev Bootcamp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an odd duck because I came straight from college with a technical degree. Most other participants had very different professional backgrounds and had the incredible nerve to quit their jobs and jump into Dev Bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dev Bootcamp knows that most people do not roll out of bed one day and think ‘I want a complete career turn around. I want to do web development’. They know that the people who do think that way come into programs like Dev Bootcamp wondering if this is truly a world in which they belong. So they nurture you and build your confidence. Everyone is there with the goal to be a web developer. It is a much more focused goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is a lot of personal support at Dev Bootcamp, they are not promising you anything for $12,000. They do not have a magic wand that turns you into a developer. The most successful people are the ones who work hard all week, stay late, go in on weekends, do all the stretch challenges and ask the most questions. Like anything in life, like college, you get what you put in. And you have to put in more than just money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-a-job&quot;&gt;Getting a Job&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had 1 internship in college. It was as an electrical engineer at a great midwestern company. I met them at U of I’s career fair. They offered me a full time job at the end of the internship. Most engineering students at U of I have at least 1 internship (they are paid) and a couple of job prospects upon graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dev Bootcamp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the cohort I graduated with, nearly 4 months later 80% of us have jobs. They are mostly full time positions at a variety of companies scattered throughout the country. Of those who do not have full time offers, they are in apprenticeships that will end with a full time offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-i-attended&quot;&gt;Why I attended&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended college because in my family, that is just the natural next step. Gap years, time off, traveling, some community college or anything else were not considered or known. Dev Bootcamps were barely in their infancy. I chose Electrical Engineering by process of elimination. I didn’t know what I wanted to do so I thought ‘engineers can do anything and get a job.’ Electrical Engineering was chosen for no better reason than I didn’t like chemistry or biology in high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dev Bootcamp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participating in Dev Bootcamp was a more well considered decision. I went through college disliking Electrical Engineering. I took a few computer science courses and enjoyed them. Then one day, I discovered the domain name of stephaniechou.com was available. I pulled out my credit card and bought it. Turns out, I loved messing around with my new little website and I wanted to learn more. But I was about to graduate, no web development classes existed and I had gone as far as I could with free online tutorials. I found out about Dev Bootcamp and applied.  I started 1 week after graduating U of I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is either course better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would NEVER suggest that Dev Bootcamp could replace a computer science degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would NEVER unequivocally declare that college was a waste of 4 years where you learn nothing of value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would NEVER argue that a Dev Bootcamp graduate cannot become a solid developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web development is one of those wonderful things that is easily accessible to anyone with a computer and internet connection. You can go very far learning on your own. Dev Bootcamp formalizes that process and gives you structure, direction and practice. College gives you the fundamental tools you need to continue building and learning. I firmly believe that you will hit a wall very hard (or at least a learning curve with a 90 degree slope) if you skip the fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My undergrad degree was like cake batter that tasted boring. Dev Bootcamp was the secret ingredient that made it all come together deliciously.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Stephanie Chou</name></author><summary type="html">There have been a lot of articles and opinions recently about Dev Bootcamps and Computer Science Degrees.
