[My Own Website!](http://stephaniechou.com)

stephaniechou.com is my own personal website! While very exciting, this is probably temporary. I am using Godaddyâ€™s website builder tool which is a lot of drag and drop. My goal is to learn HTML and CSS so I can build something that looks professional.

So exciting! This is why I am an engineer.
